# Babson · AI Providers — A Short Brief (v9)

A four-page, Babson-branded static brief making the case that bringing the three leading AI providers — **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Google** — to Babson is an easy, affordable, and common-sense move that benefits students, faculty, and staff, and reinforces Babson's position as the global leader in entrepreneurship education.

**v9 pulls back the rhetoric:** the brief now reads as a *reference resource* for getting up to speed on the three providers — not a recommendation document. Titles are graphically quieter (smaller H1/H2 at lower weight); eyebrows carry the visual structure. Direct-ask language ("the right move," "the natural window," "one straightforward fall") is gone. Evidence and logic lead; the reader does the synthesizing.

Source brief: [`original prompt.md`](original%20prompt.md). PRD: [`PRD.md`](PRD.md).

## Regenerating the PDF

The PDF in the repo (`babson-ai-providers.pdf`) is generated from `report/index.html` via [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/). Whenever you change the report content, regenerate:

```bash
./build-pdf.sh
# or directly:
weasyprint report/index.html babson-ai-providers.pdf
```

Install WeasyPrint once with `brew install weasyprint` (macOS).

**Note:** the four web pages and the report HTML are currently maintained separately. Edits to the web pages do NOT auto-sync into the report. After substantive content changes, edit `report/index.html` to match, then regenerate the PDF.

## What v9 changed from v8

- **Lead with evidence, not ask.** Home no longer opens with "The right move for fall 2026 is to bring all three to Babson." It opens with: *"OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google — what each offers, what each costs, where each is deployed."* The lead paragraph positions the site as a short reference for getting up to speed, not as a proposal.
- **Removed all direct-ask language across all pages and the report.** Gone: "the right move," "the natural window," "one straightforward fall," "the actionable window" (as a stat label).
- **"Easy, Affordable, Common-sense" reframed as "Three things to note."** The three property cards are now labeled **Mature / Priced / Deployed** — descriptive observations with citations, not persuasive framing.
- **Quieter titles graphically.** H1 from ~1.55–2 rem → ~1.2–1.45 rem, weight 700 → 600. H2 from ~1.25–1.55 rem → ~1.02–1.15 rem, weight 700 → 600. Hero padding cut further (1.25 / 1.1 rem). Eyebrows now carry more of the visual structure.
- **Softer section headings.** "The institutions Babson watches have already moved" → "Where each provider has been deployed." "Three companies. One straightforward fall." → "What this looks like, side by side." Etc.
- **Report regenerated to match.** Cover subtitle, Section 1 lead, Section 4 closing, and the Easy/Affordable/Common-sense subhead all updated. PDF rebuilt (169 KB).

## What v8 changed from v7

- **Removed all Founderz / AI-THINK references.** Anywhere on the web pages, in the report, and in the references list. The "literacy layer" section on `/build/` and the AI-THINK aside on `/build/` are gone entirely. The Faculty intro on `/value/` no longer cites the Founderz announcement.
- **Pulled back Babson self-celebration.** Dropped the "32 years #1 MBA entrepreneurship" stat from the Home stat-strip (replaced with "Fall '26 / the actionable window"). Removed the legacy section from Home. The closing on `/value/` no longer claims "global leader in entrepreneurship education" framing. References to "F.W. Olin Graduate School," "32 years," and similar self-celebration are gone.
- **Refocused on the three providers.** Home now opens with: *"Three companies make the AI that students need. The right move for fall 2026 is to bring all three to Babson."* The Home page adds a **peer momentum block** showing all four peer institution clusters at once (OpenAI peers, Anthropic peers, Google peers).
- **Sharper synthesis on `/providers/`.** New H2: *"Three companies. One straightforward fall."* Closing green aside lands four beats: availability, pricing, peer adoption, and fall 2026 timing.
- **Report + PDF regenerated.** `/report/index.html` rebuilt by an agent to match the new tone. `./build-pdf.sh` regenerated `babson-ai-providers.pdf` (169 KB, was 198 KB).
- **References slimmed.** Dropped the two Babson-self-celebration sources (32-year ranking + Founderz announcement). Total unique cited URLs across all four pages: **21** (was 23).

## What v7 changed from v6

- **Dynamic layout pass.** Every page now uses horizontal composition primitives instead of stacking sections vertically.
  - **`.split`** (with `.split-even`, `.split-aside`, `.split-right` modifiers) for two-column body sections.
  - **`.stat-strip`** + **`.stat`** — a horizontal row of large metrics in every page's hero / page-head (e.g., "32 yrs #1," "1,000+ peer institutions," "$15–20/user/month").
  - **`.aside`** / **`.aside.aside-green`** for boxed callouts inside `.split` layouts.
  - **`.cards.cards-4`** — denser 4-up card grid, used for the 6×3 benefit grid on the Value page.
  - **`.vignettes-2`** — 2×2 vignette grid, used on Build (4 SVP teams) and on each Providers section (3–4 peer schools).
- **Page-by-page changes:**
  - **`/`** (Home) — split hero (text + stat-strip), split body sections with Founderz aside, 3-up provider summary cards, 3-up Easy/Affordable/Common-sense cards.
  - **`/value/`** — split page-head with stat-strip, three group sections each using `.split.split-aside` (sticky-ish group label on the left, 6 benefit cards in 3-col grid on the right), synthesis section with green aside callout.
  - **`/build/`** — split page-head with stat-strip, Founderz `.aside.aside-green` callout, four SVP vignettes in a 2x2 grid.
  - **`/providers/`** — split page-head with stat-strip, each provider section uses `.split.split-aside` (cost table on left, peer vignettes in 2x2 on right), synthesis section with green aside.
- **Print CSS extended.** New rules flatten the split-grid / stat-strip / aside primitives back to single-column on print so the browser-printed version still works (the canonical print artifact remains `/report/` → `babson-ai-providers.pdf`).
- **Result:** roughly 40–50% less vertical scroll, denser visual rhythm, more dynamic feel.

## What v6 added (still in place)

- Density pass on `site.css` (line-height 1.45, smaller hero padding, 2-column refs above 720px, etc.).
- Single-page `/report/` consolidation of all four pages.
- Downloadable PDF (`babson-ai-providers.pdf`) generated via WeasyPrint, linked from every page's nav.
- `@media print` block for cleanly printing the web pages.

---

## Tone (unchanged from v5)

- The brief argues a clear case via choice of evidence and framing — not via "you should…" copy.
- No "frontier" / "labs" terminology. "The three leading AI providers" / "the three providers" / "AI."
- No "Babson should," no "pilot," no tier structure. Where peer history includes a literal pilot, the word is rephrased.
- Every load-bearing fact is footnoted to a verified source URL.
